- **Dependency scanning**: Known vulnerability database integration
- **SAST/DAST capabilities**: Static and dynamic analysis
- **CVE tracking**: Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures monitoring
- **Remediation guidance**: Automated fix suggestions

### 8. Rate Limiting & DDoS Protection (`rate_limiter.py`)
- **Advanced algorithms**: Token bucket, sliding window, adaptive limiting
- **Multi-layer protection**: Per-second, per-minute, per-hour limits
- **DDoS detection**: Burst attack detection, sustained attack analysis
- **Geographic filtering**: IP-based location analysis
- **Progressive penalties**: Escalating blocks for repeat offenders

### 9. Secure AI Manager (`secure_ai.py`)
- **Model interaction security**: Request/response validation
- **Content filtering**: Dangerous response pattern detection
- **Model whitelisting**: Approved model enforcement
- **Parameter sanitization**: Safe model option enforcement
- **Usage monitoring**: AI interaction audit trails

### 10. Security Monitoring (`security_monitor.py`)
- **Real-time alerting**: Immediate threat notifications
- **Health monitoring**: System component status tracking
- **Performance metrics**: Security overhead monitoring
- **Incident response**: Automated containment procedures

### 11. Threat Detection (`threat_detector.py`)
- **Behavioral analysis**: User behavior anomaly detection
- **Pattern matching**: Advanced threat signature detection
- **Risk scoring**: Multi-factor threat assessment
- **Machine learning**: Adaptive threat recognition

## üõ°Ô∏è ENTERPRISE SECURITY FEATURES

### Zero-Trust Architecture
- **Never trust, always verify**: All requests authenticated and authorized
- **Principle of least privilege**: Minimal required permissions
- **Continuous verification**: Ongoing security validation

### Defense in Depth
- **Multiple security layers**: Overlapping protection mechanisms
- **Fail-secure design**: Security failures result in denial rather than exposure
- **Redundant controls**: Multiple security checks for critical operations

### Security by Design
- **Built-in security**: Security integrated from the ground up
- **Secure defaults**: Safe configurations out of the box
- **Privacy by design**: Data protection embedded in architecture

### Enterprise Integration
- **API security**: RESTful API with OAuth2/JWT authentication
- **SSO support**: SAML, OAuth, OpenID Connect integration
- **Directory services**: LDAP/Active Directory compatibility
- **Compliance frameworks**: SOC 2, ISO 27001, NIST compliance
