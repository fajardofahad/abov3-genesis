```python
from abov3.infrastructure.orchestrator import infrastructure_context, InfrastructureConfig

config = InfrastructureConfig(
    project_path=Path.cwd(),
    enable_monitoring=True,
    enable_ai_integration=True,
    enable_auto_scaling=True
)

async with infrastructure_context(config) as orchestrator:
    # Infrastructure automatically managed
    status = await orchestrator.get_infrastructure_status()
    # Automatic cleanup on exit
